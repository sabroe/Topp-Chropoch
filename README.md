Java libraries addressing the control of the timeline as seen from application code.


## Introduction

I do software development for a living.
My interests include all things Java related
as well as all skills needed to produce great software.

Maintainable software implies that loose coupling and high cohesion is of interest leading to
the collection of useful utilities to examine if coherent libraries can be manifested.

### Scope

The functionalities address Java SE 21:

* Clock assembly - create your own timeline, fixed or accelerated
* Run your system at any time - select your preferred period
* Accelerated feedback at, say, 24x or 48x normal speed - improve your choices gained by a short testing cycle
* Assistance for internal timing - get your set latencies and durations adjusted 
* Open, non-intrusive context of plain Java SE, Jakarta CDI, Spring Framework, Quarkus - choose your platform composition

Started March 2024.

### Naming

The naming _Chropoch_ is the result of a composition of _chrono_ and _epoch_.

Chrono refers to time, chronology is the science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time.
An epoch is an instant in time.
